Here we have 6 cities in a rural area. It has been estimated that for the population of all
6 cities building 1 hospital is sufficient and cost effective. As part of the City planning
division, you are tasked to decide which city we must build the hospital in. To do this
one must think of alot constraints, eg: one can decide to place the hospital at the city
with the highest population among the 6 cities. Assume that all the other constraints
are equal in each city. You must place the hospital such that the ambulances in the
hospital can attend to each city at the shortest time. The weighted undirected graph
provided in Fig.1 has cities as nodes and edges as average time taken from each city to
another city(where possible not all cities have roads between them).

By changing the source node, need to take the shortest time between
source city to all the other cities. (Eg: if source city 0, then you must calculate
the shortest time between City 0 to City 1, City 0 to City 2, City 0 to City 3...
etc).
